Due to healthcare providers understocking their vaccine fridges, there is unfilled demand and uncaptured business value that Pfizer would like resolve. Pfizer hopes to better understand which healthcare providers are understocking their fridges and use eCommerce marketing to optimize their distribution of vaccines and increase profits.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: 
1. Conducting a linear regression on understocked orders showed the central south region contributed most significantly. 
1. Arilatapide and Furmantadmine are the most understocked brands in IK, AR, TN, and MS
2. Found no significant difference in seasonal understocking
3. Plan to pilot virtual fridge application in Central Southern USA

EXECUTIVE ASK: I am asking for $1 million to fund the PfizerPro3000 application, the virtual fridge program, and pilot Internet of Things (IoT) fridge chip sensors that connect to the virtual fridge feature.
